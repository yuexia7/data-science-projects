## Background information

Customer Personality Analysis involves conducting an in-depth examination of a company's ideal customer base. Its purpose is to enhance the business's understanding of its customers and facilitate the customisation of products to meet diverse customer segments' unique needs, behaviours, and concerns. This analysis allows businesses to refine their strategies and approaches to cater to their target customers better.

## Target:

The project needs to perform clustering to summarise customer segments.
